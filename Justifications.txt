Installed Objects

Installing an InstalledObject(eg wall) -> spawns a copy of wall object, sorted in the holder
Generating a LooseObject (eg log) -> spawns a new LooseObject, using the factory to generate with the appropriate stats

The is bc installed objects fundemetnally change their tile, so the tile will store info about the modifying object
Loose objects simply sit in a tile, but are entities in their own right
